				<span>The sickness hot, a master quit, for fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His house in town, and left one servant there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ease him corrupted, and gave means to know</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A Cheater, and his punk; who now brought low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaving their narrow practice, were become</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cozeners at large; and only wanting some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>House to set up, with him they here contract,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each for a share, and all begin to act.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much company they draw, and much abuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In casting figures, telling fortunes, news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Selling of flies, flat bawdry with the stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it, and they, and all in fume are gone.</span>
